# React-aframe-AR-test

This example want to show a basic approach to implement AR.js with aframe.js into a React app.

## Basic setup

The aframe.js and aframe-ar.js must be in the public folder and should be imported in the `<head></head>` section of the `index.html` file in this way:

```html
<script src="%PUBLIC_URL%/js/aframe.js"></script>
<script src="%PUBLIC_URL%/js/aframe-ar.js"></script>
```

alternatively you can import them from the CDN network:

```html
<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.9.2/aframe.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/1.6.2/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js"></script>

```

Minified version of the libs are in place too.
Used **1.6.2** version of aframe-ar.js.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### Before starting
You need to install the node modules on the project in a console run:

`npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
